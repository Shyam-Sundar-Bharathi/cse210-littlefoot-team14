# Review Doc for littlefoot.js

## 1. Architecture Design

littlefoot.js is designed as a lightweight JavaScript library that enhances HTML footnotes. The architecture follows a modular approach:

1. **Core Functionality**: The main `littlefoot` function in `src/littlefoot.ts` serves as the entry point, setting up the footnotes and returning an object with methods for activation, dismissal, and configuration.

2. **DOM Manipulation**: Functions in `src/dom/document.ts` and `src/dom/events.ts` handle DOM setup and event listeners.

3. **Use Cases**: The `createUseCases` function in `src/use-cases.ts` encapsulates the main behaviors of the library.

4. **Settings**: Default settings and types are defined in `src/settings.ts`, allowing for easy customization.

5. **Styling**: CSS styles are defined in `src/littlefoot.css`, using CSS custom properties for theming.

This architecture promotes separation of concerns and modularity, making the codebase more maintainable and extensible compared to Bigfoot.js, which was primarily contained in a single file.

## 2. Code Organization

The code is well-organized into separate files and modules:

- `src/littlefoot.ts`: Main entry point
- `src/dom/`: DOM-related functionality
- `src/use-cases.ts`: Core behaviors
- `src/settings.ts`: Configuration options
- `src/littlefoot.css`: Styles

This structure improves readability and maintainability compared to Bigfoot.js's single-file approach.

## 3. Pattern and Language Use

1. **Language**: The project uses TypeScript, providing type safety and better tooling support compared to Bigfoot.js's CoffeeScript.

2. **Module Pattern**: ES6 modules are used for better code organization and encapsulation.

3. **Functional Approach**: The code tends towards a more functional style, with pure functions and immutable data structures.

4. **Event Handling**: The library uses modern event handling techniques, improving efficiency and readability.

5. **CSS Custom Properties**: The use of CSS custom properties allows for easy theming and customization.

## 4. Repository Organization

The repository structure is clear and follows modern JavaScript project conventions:

- `src/`: Source code
- `test/`: Test files
- `dist/`: Distribution files (generated)
- `docs/`: Documentation
- Configuration files in the root directory

This structure is more organized and easier to navigate compared to Bigfoot.js.

## 5. Tool Quality

The project uses modern development tools:

- Rollup for bundling
- Vitest for unit testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- PostCSS for CSS processing
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

This toolset provides a more robust and efficient development experience compared to Bigfoot.js's use of Grunt.

## 6. Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
1. TypeScript for improved type safety and developer experience
2. Include test suite for CI.
3. CSS custom properties for easy theming
4. Clear and modular code structure

Disadvantages:
